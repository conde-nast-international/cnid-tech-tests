# Overview

This is a coding exercise to help us assess candidates looking to join the team at Cond√© Nast. The task is intended to be completed at home. We appreciate the time you spend on it and we will go through your submitted work together when you're invited to meet us face-to-face.        

## Which test shall I pick?
 - [Software Engineer](se-test)
 - [Infrastructure Engineer](infra-task)   
 - [iOS Engineer](ios-task)   

## How to submit code
We prefer to see your work as a GIT repo with commits from which the app is built up.
You can submit by sending up the link to a public git repository on Github, or if you'd 
like to keep the submission only between us, use [git bundle](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bundle) and submit the zipped work.

Send the work to your **point of contact**. 

## What we are looking for?
These points serve as a guide on what we look for in a code submission. Not all points have to be met
 - The solution fulfils the brief
 - There is some attempt at creating documentation
 - There is a README that instructs how to run the app
 - The app runs when you follow the README, or `npm start`, or run the iOS app
 - There are reasonably thorough tests
 - The file/folder structure is intuitive
 - Code style is consistent
 - Chosen technologies are appropriate
 - Complex sections of code are readable/commented/justified
 - Not over-simplified or over-engineered
