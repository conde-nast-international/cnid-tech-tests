# Interview

This is a coding exercise to help us assess candidates looking to join the team at CondÃ© Nast International.  The test is intended to be completed at home, which we estimate should take around x-y hours.  We understand that your time is valuable, and appreciate any time that you contribute towards building a strong team here.

### Task

There is a JSON file containing 10 articles.  An article has fixed data such as the title and cover image, but also has a content field which is an array of objects that can be distinguished by the ```type``` property.  The possible types in this dataset are ```plaintext```, ```pull_quote``` and ```h2```. Using this JSON file as your data source we would like you to create a website that does the following:

- The root of the site should display a list of the articles, with their title and picture.
- Clicking an article should take you to a page that displays the article and update the url.
- The article page should layout the content with styling for each type of content.  For example a pull quote may look like this:

> Your pull quote may look something like this


### What we are looking for

- We anticipate that the website may have future requirements, so you should aim for maintainability with your solution.
- The javascript ecosystem changes quickly, so we like to see knowledge of javascript fundamentals
- We want to discover how you write code day-to-day
- We don't want you to spend hours tweaking every pixel.  Keep it simple.

### Submission

You can submit your code however you want - send the details to your point of contact.  Please include a README containing any setup instructions and keep the setup steps simple.
