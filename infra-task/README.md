# Infrastructure Interview Tech Task

## Context

In the final stage of our interview process we want to discover how you handle infrastructure day-to-day. In preparation for the interview we request you complete the following task.

This is a coding exercise to help us assess candidates looking to join the Infrastructure Engineering team at Condé Nast. It is not a pass or fail, but it will be used as the basis for questions and discussion in the interview.   
We appreciate that your time is valuable, which is why we’ve designed this exercise to be completed in around 1-2 hours. If you cannot spare the time, you may want to consider option 2.

 
### Things we want to see

- An ability to handle code like a software engineer
- Maintainability of solutions
- Containers
- Infrastructure as Code
- Monitoring
- Consideration of CI/CD
- Resilience
- Ability to develop applications locally in a consistent environment
- Concise documentation (please include a README)

## Option 1

Create a simple 'Hello World' web application (for example, node.js) and deploy it to a Cloud Infrastructure, such as an AWS account, using appropriate tools and best practices. 

You are expected to demonstrate containerisation, pipelines and a minimal orchestration setup of your choice.  When deployed, the root url should display 'Hello World'. 

** Please note:  The application is not the important factor in this, it is the infrastructure we will want to discuss.**

## Option 2

If you have some personal code that you would be prepared to share with us, we can assess that instead.  The code should meet the following criteria:

- It should be your own work.
- Ideally, it should involve an element of web development platform
- It should demonstrate how you approach any particular problem
- It should be something that you are able to discuss with us
- It should cover most of the points that we are looking for in option 1

## Submission

Please submit everything as a github repo - send the details to your point of contact.  Please include a README containing any relevant information.
You will be expected to screen share and walk us through your sumbission during the interview.
