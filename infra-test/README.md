# Interview

## Context

This is a coding exercise to help us assess candidates looking to join the Infrastructure Engineering team at Condé Nast International, we want to discover how you handle infrastructure day-to-day.  We appreciate that your time is valuable, which is why we’ve designed this exercise to be completed in around 2 hours. If you cannot spare the time, you may want to consider option 2.
 
### Things we like

- An ability to handle code like a software engineer
- Maintainability of solutions
- Resilience, particularly to Chaotic Monkeys
- Ability to develop applications locally in a consistent environments
- Concise documentation
- Containers
- Infrastructure as Code
- Monitoring, but you shouldn’t be concerned about it for now
- CI/CD, again, don’t worry about this for this exercise

## Option 1

Create a node.js 'Hello World' web application and deploy it to a Cloud Infrastructure, such as an AWS account, using appropriate tools and best practices.  When deployed, the root url should display 'Hello World'. 

## Option 2

If you have some personal code that you would be prepared to share with us, we can assess that instead.  The code should meet the following criteria:

- It should be your own work.
- Ideally, it should involve an element of web development platform
- It should demonstrate how you approach any particular problem
- It should be something that you are able to discuss with us
- It should cover as many of the points that we are looking for in option 1

## Submission

You can submit your code however you want - send the details to your point of contact.  Please include a README containing any relevant information.
