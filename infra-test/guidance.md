1. We ask that it is returned within 3 working days of receiving the test if possible but please let us know if you require additional time. 
1. The test is not time restricted - we do not force a maximum time limit to complete it - though it is suggested to be completed in approximately 2 hours. There is also no minimum time restriction.
1. We want to see what you can achieve within that time that you have: how you approach the task and how you deal with the complexity of the solution. Whether you can complete the solution or not, the importance of showing your development skills is paramount.
1. We know you have good infrastructure and operations background. We want you to demonstrate that experience in the short time that you have to complete the task. 
1. The application is not the important factor in this test, it is the infrastructure.
1. We want to see how you develop your infrastructure and how you apply good DevOps principles.
1. We are a software engineering team and have an expectation of your ability to handle code. We want to see that your workflow is suitable to our team. 
1. We want you to apply the information you have gained from talking to us (and others) to the solution if possible.
1. Documentation is paramount. We have keen eye on how you present the information and how can it be used. (Our team is a group of skilled Infrastructure Developers who work with skilled Application Developers.)
