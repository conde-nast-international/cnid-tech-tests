# Overview
This task is intended for people who interview for our Software Engineer roles.

Please make sure you read [our expectations](../README.md#what-we-are-looking-for) first before starting on any of the below options:   

## Option 1

Build a JavaScript application that shows the latest news world-wide, using the [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org) service.

Running the app we should be able to see the latest **news**. The user should have the ability to filter by keywords (see [everything endpoint api](https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything)). Optionally, if the user clicks on a news item it will navigate to a page displaying the full news article selected.

This is a full stack challenge and we are expecting both a Frontend application and a Backend application that communicate with each other.

A Full Stack developer is someone with familiarity in each layer; you might be stronger on the frontend, or vice-versa. Feel free to focus more on what you know best, be creative and show us your skills!

## Option 2

If you have some existing code that you would be prepared to share with us, we can look at that instead. The code should
meet the following criteria:

* It should be similar hours of your own work as with Option 1 (as opposed to others' or your team's work for example)
* Ideally, it should be a web/mobile app that involves both client and server-side skills
* It should demonstrate how you approach a problem with a simple solution that you're confident to walk us through in an interview scene (as opposed to sharing an app of 10k LOC for example) 
* It should be something that's legit to share with us (as opposed to NDA protected stuff for example)
